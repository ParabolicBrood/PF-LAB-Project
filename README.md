  - Add new products to the catalog.
  - Manage and view product inventory.
  - Add, remove, or update product details.
- **Buyer Access:**
  - Browse the product catalog.
  - Add products to the cart.
  - View cart and calculate the total cost.

## How to Use:
1. **Admin Mode:**
   - Enter the admin PIN (`1234`) to access admin features.
   - Add products, manage inventory, or view the catalog.

2. **Buyer Mode:**
   - Enter the buyer PIN (`5678`) to access the buyer features.
   - Browse the catalog, add products to your cart, and view the total cost of your purchase.

3. **Payment:**
   - Currently, the system only supports cash payment.

## How to Run:
1. Compile and run the program in any C++ compatible IDE or compiler.
2. Enter your PIN to log in as either a buyer or admin.
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the product catalog.

## Example:

- **Admin adds products** to the catalog and manages inventory.
- **Buyer adds items** to their cart and checks the total cost.

## Future Improvements:
